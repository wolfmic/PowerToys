## Installing and running Microsoft PowerToys

### Requirements

- Windows 11 or Windows 10 version 2004 (code name 20H1 / build number 19041) or newer.
- Our installer will install the following items:
   - [Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) bootstrapper. This will install the latest version.

### Via GitHub with EXE [Recommended]

Go to [Microsoft PowerToys GitHub releases page][github-release-link], click on `Assets` at the bottom to show the files available in the release. Please use the appropriate PowerToys installer that matches your machine's architecture and install scope. For most, it is `x64` and per-user.
 
 - **For x64 processors (most common) per-user installer:** [PowerToysUserSetup-0.69.1-x64.exe](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/download/v0.69.1/PowerToysUserSetup-0.69.1-x64.exe)
 - **For x64 processors per-machine installer:** [PowerToysSetup-0.69.1-x64.exe](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/download/v0.69.1/PowerToysSetup-0.69.1-x64.exe)
 - **For ARM64 processors per-user installer:** [PowerToysUserSetup-0.69.1-arm64.exe](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/download/v0.69.1/PowerToysUserSetup-0.69.1-arm64.exe)
 - **For ARM64 processors per-machine installer:** [PowerToysSetup-0.69.1-arm64.exe](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/download/v0.69.1/PowerToysSetup-0.69.1-arm64.exe)

This is our preferred method.

### Via Microsoft Store

Install from the [Microsoft Store's PowerToys page][microsoft-store-link]. You must be using the [new Microsoft Store](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsExperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/) which is available for both Windows 11 and Windows 10.

### Via WinGet
Download PowerToys from [WinGet][winget-link]. Updating PowerToys via winget will respect current PowerToys installation scope. To install PowerToys, run the following command from the command line / PowerShell:

#### User scope installer [default]
```powershell
winget install Microsoft.PowerToys -s winget
```

#### Machine-wide scope installer

```powershell
winget install --scope machine Microsoft.PowerToys -s winget
```

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficialInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop. If these are your preferred install solutions, you can find the install instructions there.
